# GPT4Free
Its not actually the real gpt, but im using an external api so yep

# To use this just do these things:

the bearer token (jwt) is always required and well, its expire after some time so u need always new ones <:

Thats an example of the decoded jtw: 
```json
{"alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}{"iat":1763004248386,"exp":1763005148,"bundleId":"com.chatbot.ai.aichat.openaibot.chat","os":"Android","versionApp":"35.0.2"}
```
so u have to use the modded version to get the premium auth token, get it here: **<a href="https://t.me/c/2365551068/334">Join the group</a>** (private channel, make a request to join)

u should know how to get the token via **<a href="https://httptoolkit.com/">Httptoolkit</a>** intercept the app that's all, and use **<a href="https://www.memuplay.com/">Memu</a>** for an emulator , easyy

# if i can find any new free apis i will create a py script and provide it here.
